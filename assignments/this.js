/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. (global binding) called in the global points to the window
* 2. (implicit binding) this points to the object before the dot when a function is called by a preceeding dot - 
* 3. (new binding) constructor function is used points this to the object - that is created and returned by that constructor function
* 4. (explicit binding) call () apply() methods are explicitly defined and set what this points to
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
